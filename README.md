Hi Steven,
here is the project for testing the requested scenario:
  
  - Create basic test cases (2 or more) for the following site: http://newtours.demoaut.com/ for Login and find a flight (for dates 15th – 20nd March 2018) then book the flight. Then book a second flight for different destination with (for dates 24th – 31st May 2018)
  - Code the necessary framework to automate those test cases..
  - Technologies to be used: (at least) Selenium WebDriver and Java

As I said, I did not have experience with Cucumber, so I tried to get fimiliar with it. Probably with TestNG it would be much easier and faster for me. 

Please, let me know if you would welcome any adjustment to it. Last week, we did a reconstruction of our appartment, so I did not have so much time. It should be better now.

Thank you,
Jiri
